<div id="What">
    <h1 style="color:#2b0080"><i>What is the Rutgers CliMIT Fellowship? What was my role in it?</i></h1>
</div>

<p>In fall 2023, the Rutgers CliMIT Fellowship had its inaugural cohort. Around 30 students from Rutgers worked on teams to research and develop tech-based solutions to flooding in New Brunswick.</p>
    
<p>I had the amazing opportunity to serve as the Entrepreneurial Lead for my team.</p>

<p>I worked on a team of 3 to research and think of a tech-based solution that could mitigate the impacts of flooding in New Brunswick, New Jersey.</p>

<p>Through this experience, I had the opportunity to develop valuable communication, teamwork, leadership, public speaking, and entrepreneurial skills. </p>

<p>Here is a brief overview of the program and its goals: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fnBdTuPansrr6R1j9RGXqWnQciupaLcv/view?usp=sharing">CliMIT Overview</a></p>

<p> Below, I discuss my experience. </p>

<table style="background-color: #e1f5dc;">
    <tbody><tr>
<td><div id="prob">
    <h1 style="color:#2b0080;"><i>Problem Statement</i></h1>
</div>
<h3>Brief Version</h3>
<p>The problem that we decided to address was efficiently modernizing first-responders' flood response preparation and training. Our solution will help first responders become familiar with flood response protocols and get more knowledgeable about the cities they respond in.
</p>
<h3>Expanded Version</h3>
<p>First responders and EMTs find it difficult to efficiently preplan flood responses without a visual representation of the city/response area, especially when they are not familiar with it.
</p>
<p>There are many distinct/independent flood preplanning and emergency response preparedness tools that exist (flood simulators, flood preplanning and hazard analysis tools). 
</p>
<p>
    </p><ul>
        <li>However, no major effort has really been put forth in synthesizing all of these,  and facilitating effective flood preplanning and response all in one place. 
        </li>
        <li>Also, a lot of them are very technical in nature, and we haven't found a simpler, more gamified yet still useful version out there that first responders can use. 
        </li>
    </ul>
<p></p>
</td>

<tr>
<td><div id="sol">
    <h1 style="color:#2b0080"><i>Solution</i></h1>
</div>
<h3>Brief Version</h3>
<p>Our solution is a first-responder-friendly, easy-to-use program/game that can simulate real life flooding situations that emergency personnel may face. 
</p>
<p>It's essentially a virtual 3d replica of New Brunswick, with a bit of flood simulation capability within it. Users will be able to simulate various levels of floods, visualize the potential impacts of flooding, and experience the flood situation very realistically.
</p>
<h3>Expanded Version</h3>
<p>To do this, we would first create a 3d simulation of the city of New Brunswick in the ArcGIS CityEngine software. Then, we would import this into a game engine like Unity or Unreal Engine, and add other features (flood simulator (where users can simulate various flood levels on the city, mark areas of high risk, and visualize potential flooding scenarios to better prepare for flood response).
</p>
<p>The end product would be the 3d flood simulator in the game engine that first responders and eventually regular people can use for flood preparedness
</p>

<div id="mark">
    <h1 style="color:#2b0080;"><i>Market Opportunity</i></h1>
</div>

<p>Our primary consumers would be first responders such as EMS and firefighters, as well as the New Brunswick government. We would hope to expand this customer base as we develop more everyman-usable derivatives of this product, like an educational video game.
</p>


<div id="comp">
    <h1 style="color:#2b0080"><i>Competition</i></h1>
</div>
<h3>Brief Version</h3>
<p>Our solution is unique from the competition, as it requires less technical expertise on the part of the end user, would be cheaper than other solutions, would be customized to New Brunswick, and would allow users to interact (e.g. mark high-risk areas) with the environment.
</p>
<h3>Expanded Version</h3>
<p>A major flood modeling software that exists is ArcGIS Flood Impact Analysis. Using it requires end-users to find terrain data, manipulate it, and take many other steps before creating a finalized, usable, realistic flood simulator.</p>
<p>
    Unique selling points for our innovation:
    </p><ul>
        <li>
            Easy to use for first responders - can easily simulate flooding scenarios with a few clicks. 
        </li>
        <li>Free in the beginning (hopefully cheaper than other solutions later on/after monetization)
        </li>
        <li>
            Customized to New Brunswick 
        </li>
        <li>
            Allows users to mark hazard/high-risk areas, preplan for floods quickly and effectively
        </li>
    </ul>

<div id="biz">
    <h1 style="color:#2b0080;"><i>Business Model</i></h1>
</div>
<h3>Brief Version</h3>
<p>We'd use crowdfunding and partnerships with other companies to raise money. We'd also have hierarchical pricing structures (e.g. monthly, yearly subscription plans)
</p>
<h3>Expanded Version</h3>
<p>
    We would first look for partnerships with other companies that would help us raise money and create our idea. Assuming that our idea gains popularity we would then sell the game to emergency training facilities. </p>
<p>Crowdfunding would also be another way to try and get our idea started. 
</p>
<p>Regarding pricing, we'd eventually have different membership tiers with various features for each (e.g. bronze - just flood modeling, silver - flood modeling and build in simulations, etc). We plan to make money through yearly and monthly subscription plans. 
</p>

<div id="market val">
    <h1 style="color:#2b0080"><i>Market Validation</i></h1>
</div>
<h3>Brief Version</h3>
<p>I arranged interviews with local firefighters and EMS personnel. One of the fire department chiefs said that having a 3D simulation of the city in general can be paramount in helping first responders better understand what a potential flood scene would look like and determine areas with flood risk. This reveals the usefulness of our technology.
</p>

<h3>Expanded Version</h3>
<p>
    In addition to the above, the simulation:
    </p><ul>
        <li>could help in training and making simulations more effective          </li>
        <li>would also assist in incident management, designation of flood hazards around the city, and flood response preplanning
        </li>
        <li>Would benefit first responders and flood response as a whole
        </li>
    </ul>

<p>I was successful in organizing team meetings to get work for the fellowship done, delegated necessary tasks to team members, helped in evaluating benefits and drawbacks of potential solutions that were offered by my team, and had my team's back in pivoting away from one solution (that we thought was good) to another. 
</p>    
<p>Our team successfully presented our solution to government officials and others in the fellowship.</p>

    <h1 style="color:#2b0080;"><i>Challenges</i></h1>
</div>

<ul>
    <li>One of our members was difficult to communicate with, and we had to work without him over the course of the semester as he had other commitments. In adapting to this, I ensured that the workload I delegated to the rest of the members of my team didn't overwhelm them. I also delegated based on team members' strengths.
    </li>
    <li>It was difficult to find research about flooding online. In hindsight, we could have set up interviews with people in New Brunswick to find out about potential problem areas more effectively. 
     </li>
    <li>The innovation process was difficult, as our team didn not know which problem area would be best/most feasible to address in flood mitigation. 
        <ul>
            <li>We started off with the idea of creating a Google Maps-esque app that would allow users to plan necessary trips, get notified of any flood alerts/which roads are most likely to be flooded along the route, and get alternative route recommendations.
            </li>
            <li>We had to drop the idea at the last minute as we were not able to make progress after a point due to feasibility constraints, and thought it was too similar to Google Maps flooding feature.
            </li>
            <li>However, we were quickly able to pivot to another type of solution.</li>
        </ul>
     </li>
</ul>
</td>

<div id="areas">
    <h1 style="color:#2b0080"><i>Areas for Improvement</i></h1>
</div>
<p>In hindsight, a lower-tech solution that focuses on community engagement and education, or flood preparedness, would have been more feasible and convincing as a solution to flood mitigation. Such a solution would likely have been more scalable and useful, in my opinion.
